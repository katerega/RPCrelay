Hey [Name],
Saw you’re running [arbitrage bot / NFT sniper].
I run DigPeg Ultra Relay — sub-200ms private RPC endpoints for BSC, Base, Arbitrum, and ETH.
Clients using it have seen 40–60% fewer failed tx and faster block inclusion.
I can set you up today with a $50 trial.
Want me to send you the link?

Step 4 — Close the Deal (Same Day)
When they say yes, send them:
